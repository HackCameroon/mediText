# mediText  

MediText is a web application designed and catered to help reminder patients to take their medications. Our web application allows patients to receive notifications once they're prescribed by the doctor. Additionally, they would be able to add their own reminders. Our system includes a database that doctors would be able to access and logins for each user for security.
